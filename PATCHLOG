Patch4
======

For Pat Rankin (nethack.rankin@eql.caltech.edu).  Under VMS, do a 
getenv("TERM") before a getenv("TERMINAL").  Add more Dec terminals to the 
termcap file.

Courtesy of Andreas Wettengel (andreas@nixhhs.uucp).  Modify bill.c to
produce RFC822-conformant mail headers, compiled using the new RFCMAIL
#define.  This allows elm and other conformant mail programs to display
the Subject and Sender correctly.

To satisfy several requests, I have brought back the descriptions of the
compile-time defines into the makefile.  I have also updated the list to
include the more recent additions.

Modify main.c to include and make use of PATCHLEVEL.  This requires those
using MSDOS or OS/2 to change patchlevel.h to patchlev.h.  The 'v' command
will now print out the patchlevel as part of the version information.

As pointed out by Andreas Wettengal, the second parameter to tputs() should
be one if its to have no affect.  

Fix a bug pointed out by Gordon D. (frog!gordon).  Reading a scroll of 
teleport without picking it up leaves it behind when you teleport, allowing
you to read it again.

Fix the help file spelling mistakes and spell-casting lister in the help file
with escape sequences.

Patch3
======

Courtesy of Scott Robins (scottr@scottr.dec.com).  Modifications and new
files that allow Larn 12.2 to be compiled for OS/2 using Microsoft C.  Some
of the changes may be applicable to MS-DOS Microsoft C as well.

Patch2
======

Courtesy of Pat Rankin (nethack.rankin@EQL.Caltech.Edu).  In the on-line
help, fix the spelling mistakes with 'wield', and change the spell-casting 
lister from 'D' to 'I', as its implemented [plain-text only].

Courtesy of Kenichi Yaoita (yaoita@cm.phys.keio.ac.jp), with an
honorable mention to Andreas Chernov (ache@hq.demos.su).  Fix
the inventory count code, which is performing invalid comparisons
(<=26 vs <26).

Also courtesy of Kenichi Yaoita, fix an invalid screen offset in
bot_spellx().

Patch1
======

Fixes the problem where no .larnopts file causes the dungeon to not be 
displayed.  Selects the "hack-like" objects.

Fixes the SIGSEV (ACCVIO) problem with the '?' command.  Append trailing blank
lines to the help file.

Courtesy of jef@helios.ee.lbl.gov (Jef Poskanzer). Bug in cursor postioning
(only appears on certain terminals).

Courtesy of nethack.rankin@eql.caltech.edu (Pat Rankin).  spells and spheres
missing from the MMS file, link against the VAXCRTL sharable instead of the
object library.
