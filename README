As promised, here is the source to Larn V12.2, the executables for which were
posted earlier this year to comp.binaries.ibm.pc.

The source correctly compiles and executes under DEC Ultrix, using the cc
compiler.  The enclosed Makefile is for U*ix systems.

The source correctly compiles and executes under VAX/VMS, using the VAX C V3.x
compiler.  The enclosed descrip.mms is a MMS file for building under VAX/VMS.

The source correctly compiles and executes under MS-DOS, using Turbo C V2.0 or
Turbo C++ V1.0.  The LARN.PRJ file is for Turbo C V2.0, but unfortunately I am
unable to properly distribute the Turbo C++ project file and setup files.  To
compiler under MS-DOS, you must define the MSDOS, DGK, SYSV, DGK_MSDOS and
NOVARARGS defines.

I am interested in receiving source changes that allow Larn to be ported to
other architectures or operating systems.  I am also interested in constructive
changes or additions to improve the game.  I am _not_ interested in arbitrary
mods, a la UltraLarn.

Bug fixes, bug reports, and requests welcome.

I am reachable at tle.enet.dec.com!routley or routley@tle.enet.dec.com.
Because I am right in the middle of moving at the moment, all USmail should be
sent to:

instead of the address listed in the documentation file.
