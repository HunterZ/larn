     1. Introduction
     ---------------

     LARN is a dungeon type adventure game similar in concept to HACK, ROGUE 
     or MORIA, but with a different feel and winning criteria.  LARN was 
     released for the UNIX environment in 1986 by Noah Morgan.  It was 
     subsequently ported to the MS-DOS environment by Don Kneller.  Kevin 
     Routley has been working on enhancements to LARN on and off for the
     past two years.


     2. System requirements
     ----------------------

     PC LARN requires:

       - MS-DOS or PC-DOS 2.x or above.

       - at least 256K of RAM.

       - disk storage capacity of at least 360K, although twice that much is
         preferred if you want to "checkpoint" your game to prevent
         accidental lose due to a system failure.


     3. Files supplied
     -----------------

       LARN.DOC          This documentation.

       LARN.FIX          Changes made between LARN V12.2 and V12.4.

       LARN.EXE          The executable file.

       LARN.FTN          Fortune cookie messages.

       LARN.HLP          A help file, which can be read with the "?"
                         command in LARN.

       LARN.MAZ          Some maze levels are pre-calculated and
                         stored here.


     4. Installation
     ---------------

     For a hard disk system I suggest creating a \GAMES\LARN directory and
     placing LARN and the provided support files in that directory.  Following
     that, you would place \GAMES\LARN in your PATH.

     LARN will create several other files (LARN.SCR, LARN.PID, LARN.LOG)
     in that directory.  Also, save files (LARN.SAV) and checkpoint files
     (LARN.CKP) will go in there by default.  You will want to set the
     'larndir:' option in your LARN.OPT file (see the Configuration section
     below) to point to this directory.

     For two-floppy systems, I would suggest the following:

         o place LARN.EXE on disk one.

         o place LARN.FTN, LARN.MAZ, and LARN.HLP on disk two.  This will
           be the 'larndir:' disk (see the Configuration section below).
           LARN.SCR, LARN.PID, LARN.LOG, save files, and checkpoint files
           will go on this disk.


     6. Command line options
     -----------------------

     There are several command line options that can modify the behavior of
     LARN.  These are:

       -s             Show scores.

       -l             Show log file.  You have to know the Wizard's password
                      to do this.

       -i             Show all scores including the inventories of dead
                      players.

       -c             Create a new score file.  You have to know the Wizard's
                      password to do this.  Erasing LARN.SCR has the same
                      effect.

       -#             Where # is a number from 0 to 9.  This sets the
                      difficulty of LARN to this level.  Normally, LARN
                      starts out with difficulty 0 and increases in
                      difficulty by 1 when you win at the current level.
                      Thus the game automatically gets more difficult.

       -h             A help screen that shows the command line arguments.


     7. WIZARD mode
     --------------

     There is a WIZARD mode for testing features of the game.  To get into
     WIZARD mode, type in an underscore "_" and answer the prompt for the
     password with "pvnert(x)" (do not enter the quotes).  Wizards are 
     non-scoring characters that get enlightenment, everlasting expanded 
     awareness and one of every object in the game.


     8. History and Other Information
     --------------------------------

     Noah Morgan originally created LARN 12.0 and released the UNIX
     version to the USENET in 1986.  Don Kneller ported the UNIX
     version to MSDOS (both IBM PCs and DEC Rainbows).

     Kevin Routley contributed various LARN enhancements. Version 12.1 had 
     a limited distribution. Version 12.2 was distributed to the Usenet 
     community. Version 12.3 was the last version released by Kevin.

     Other editions of Larn have been distributed by others, namely
     LARN13 and Ultra-Larn.

     I hope you enjoy this version of LARN.
