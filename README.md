# larn
## Introduction
This repository contains the known history of LARN source code, as gathered from the following location(s):
http://lactose.homelinux.net/larn/

The master branch contains various versions of official sources only, with each known source version being a sequential commit.

Note that these source versions are captured for historical reference. There is no guarantee that any of these versions will build in any particular environment.

I've massaged the files slightly, including some of the following changes:
* Removed some extraneous non-source files (binaries, build products, and other temp files)
* Renamed files to lowercase as appropriate
* Removed version numbers from documentation/changelog filenames for easier comparison via SCM tools
* Ran dos2unix on all files to convert line endings as appropriate (hopefully this doesn't break anything)

Official binaries are not hosted here at this time.

## Personal projects

Any ports of this code should be made on branches or in forks. These will not be merged to the master branch. Binaries built from branches may be posted here as releases.

## License information

I'm uncertain of the license status of LARN's source code. It appears to have an ambiguous FOSS license. Any information would be appreciated.

## Background

As time goes on, LARN information and source code seems to be disappearing slowly from the Internet. At the same time, the roguelike community seems to be thriving. I think it's important to try to preserve history for people who are interested in exploring the roots of the genre.

If anyone knows about any official source versions that I have not captured here, please contact me.
