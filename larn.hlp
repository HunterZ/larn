5    Welcome to the game of Larn.  At this moment, you face a great problem.
Your daughter has contracted a strange disease, and none of your home remedies
seem to have any effect.  You sense that she is in mortal danger, and you must
try to save her.  Time ago you heard of a land of great danger and opportunity.
Perhaps here is the solution you need.

    It has been said that there once was a great magician who called himself
Polinneaus.  Many years ago, after having many miraculous successes, Polinneaus
retired to the caverns of Larn, where he devoted most of his time to the
creation of magic.   Rumors have it that one day Polinneaus set out to dispel
an attacking army in a forest some distance to the north.  It is believed that
here he met his demise.

    The caverns of Larn, it is thought, must be magnificent in design,
and contain much magic and treasure.  One option you have is to undertake a
journey into these caverns.


    Good Luck!  You're going to need it!

                [7mSpecial Notes[m

When [7mdropping gold[m, if you type '*' as your amount, all your gold gets dropped.
In general, typing in '*' means all of what your interested in.  This is true
when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.

When in the store, trading post, school, or home, an [7m<escape>[m will get you out.

When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type '[7mI[m' as
the first letter of your spell.  The available list of spells will be shown,
after which you may enter the spell code.  This only works on the 1st letter
of the spell you are casting.

When an inventory list is on the screen from a drop, quaff, read, or similar
command, you can type the letter of the object that you wish to act apon,
without having to type a space to get back to the prompt.

           [7mExplanation of the Larn scoreboard facility[m

    Larn supports TWO scoreboards, one for winners, and one for deceased
characters.  Each player (by userid or playerid, see UIDSCORE in Makefile)
is allowed one slot on each scoreboard, if the score is in the top ten for
that scoreboard.  This design helps insure that frequent players of Larn
do not hog the scoreboard, and gives more players a chance for glory.  Level
of difficulty is also noted on the scoreboards, and this takes precedence
over score for determining what entry is on the scoreboard.  For example:
if "Yar, the Bug Slayer" has a score of 128003 on the scoreboard at diff 0,
then a game at diff 1 and a score of 4112 would replace the previous
entry on the scoreboard.  Note that when a player dies, the inventory is
stored in the scoreboard so that everyone can see what items the player had
at the time of death.
